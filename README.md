This is a dynamic font survey that adapts the styling of questions and inputs based on your font selection. Don't be fooled by the lack of a JavaScript file! There's a decent chunk of JavaScript code in this, I just put it within a script in the HTML file. 

This was a certification project for freeCodeCamp that was only supposed to use one HTML file and one CSS file to create a simple survey.

I revisited it to add the aforementioned JS code within those existing files to make things more interesting and fun!

Please note that this works best on PC, as some fonts don't load correctly on mobile.
