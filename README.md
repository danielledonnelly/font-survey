This is a dynamic font survey that adapts the styling of questions and inputs based on your font selection.

Don't be fooled by the lack of a JavaScript file! 
There's a decent chunk of JavaScript code in this, I just put it within a script in the HTML file. 

Why? Because this is a certification project for freeCodeCamp that is only supposed to use one HTML file and one CSS file.

That's also why my thank you page is stored within my main html file instead of a separate one. I found some loopholes to make everything work in just the two allotted files.
